        <h1>Understanding Gerrymandering</h1>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>What is Gerrymandering?</h2>
            <p>The practice of drawing the boundaries of electoral districts in a way that gives one political party an unfair advantage over its rivals 
            (political or partisan gerrymandering) or that dilutes the voting power of members of ethnic or linguistic minority groups 
            (racial gerrymandering).</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>What is its Impact?</h2>

            <h3>Political Representation and Voting Accessibility</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Dilution of Votes:</strong> Manipulates district boundaries to favor a specific party or demographic, reducing the voting power of marginalized communities, such as ethnic minorities or lower-income groups.</li>
                <li><strong>Discouragement of Voter Turnout:</strong> When voters feel their votes wonâ€™t make a difference due to unfair districting, it can discourage civic participation, especially in communities with limited voting accessibility.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Public Services and Resource Allocation</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Unequal Distribution of Resources:</strong> Districts drawn to favor certain groups may neglect others, leading to disparities in access to education, healthcare, transportation, and infrastructure.</li>
                <li><strong>Impact on Public Policy:</strong> Representatives may prioritize policies that benefit more privileged groups over those facing accessibility challenges, such as people with disabilities or underserved rural populations.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Community Cohesion and Local Advocacy</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Fragmentation of Communities:</strong> Gerrymandering often splits communities with shared interests, weakening their ability to advocate for local improvements like public transportation or disability accommodations.</li>
                <li><strong>Reduced Accountability:</strong> Politicians may become less responsive to constituents' needs when they feel secure due to gerrymandered districts.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Disparities in Healthcare and Social Services Access</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Communities underrepresented by their districts may struggle to secure funding for critical services such as mental health programs, accessible housing, and elderly transportation.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <p>Addressing gerrymandering is crucial for ensuring fair representation and equitable access to resources, services, and opportunities.</p>
